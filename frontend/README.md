# Frontend

This is the frontend for `schematic-ai-review`.

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default and expects the backend to expose `/api/hello` on the same host (see root README for backend instructions).
