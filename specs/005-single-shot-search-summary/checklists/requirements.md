# Specification Quality Checklist: 单次交互的搜索轮与摘要轮

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All legacy multi-round switches and code must be removed (backend, frontend, storage, CI, docs).
- Engine selection is automatic (native first, else Exa); no user-configurable engine.
- System is single-shot only; failure handling is retry-once then fail.
- Frontend must display combined answer and citations; timeline updated to one step.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
