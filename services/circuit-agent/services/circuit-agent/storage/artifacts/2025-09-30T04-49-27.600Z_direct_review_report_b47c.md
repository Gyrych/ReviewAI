It seems like your query for design requirements and specs is empty ("无" means "none" in Chinese). If you're looking to design something—such as a product, system, UI, or creative concept—could you provide more details? For example:

- What are you trying to design (e.g., an app, logo, architecture)?
- Any goals, constraints, or target audience?
- Preferred style, tools, or inspirations?

If this was a placeholder or test message, let me know how I can assist further!
