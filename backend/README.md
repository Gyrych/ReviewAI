# Backend

This is the backend for `schematic-ai-review`.

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` and exposes a sample endpoint `GET /api/hello`.

Note: the backend default port has been updated to `3001` to avoid common conflicts. You can still override the port with the `PORT` environment variable.
